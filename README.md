This app is a 4x4 slider puzzle game created in the IntelliJ IDEA IDE using Java (so to run it you may need to use IntelliJ).

TileApp.java is the working executable (not SliderPuzzleGameAgain.java).

The game will stall for a few seconds when you press the start button, as it starts by shuffling the puzzle.
